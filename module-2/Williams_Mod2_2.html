        <h2> Chapter 1: Introduction </h2>
        <p class="intro">
            Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Anthony Williams, and I was born and raised in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, 
            a predominantly agricultural community surrounded by farmland and the Amish. Most of my youth was spent outdoors 
            in the woods and lakes of the surrounding area. There was seldom a time that you'd catch me or my friends inside 
            binging TV shows or playing video games.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I was 22, I joined the U.S. Navy as an Aviation Electronics Technician and spent the next 5 years traveling 
            all across the world to new and exotic lands, learning many skills along the way that would serve me well in my 
            future career in aerospace contracting. I also had the good fortune of meeting my spouse during my enlistment, where 
            we served together in Strike Fighter Squadron VFA-154. Though I was happy to separate from the service when I did, 
            I will always look back on those days fondly and with gratitude.
        </p>
        <p>
            As an avid learner, I enjoy spending my free time learning about all sorts of topics and skills, specifically in 
            science, engineering, philosophy, health, and writing. While I admittedly don't incorporate as many lessons as I 
            should from these areas, I find that actively engaging with the work is often more fulfilling than passively engaging 
            in other forms of entertainment. <span class="sentence">Although it's hard to pass up a relaxing evening with 
            The Office or The Big Bang Theory.</span> 
        </p>
        <p>
            With the overwhelming amount of knowledge and wisdom that I've been exposed to over the past few years, I feel as 
            though I'm entering a transitional period in my life, which will now be heavily focused on finding unique innovations 
            to complex problems. Because I believe that software will play an outsized role in providing many of these solutions, 
            I'm beginning my journey here at Bellevue to learn the art of programming. Hopefully, one day, I will be able to take 
            the skills I acquire here and use them to help us progress into a more optimistic and exciting future.
