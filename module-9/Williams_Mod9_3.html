        <p>
          If you are fundamentally building and marketing something 
          that is an extension of who you are, no one can compete with 
          you on that. Who’s going to compete with <span id="person1">_______</span> 
          or <span id="person2">_______</span>? It’s impossible. 
          Is somebody else going to come along 
          and write a better Dilbert? No. Is someone going to compete 
          with Bill Watterson and create a better Calvin and Hobbes? No. 
          They’re being authentic.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most important skill for getting rich is becoming a 
          <span id="skill">_______</span>. You have to know how to learn 
          anything you want to learn. The old model of making money is 
          going to school for four years, getting your degree, and working 
          as a professional for thirty years. But things change fast now. 
          Now, you have to come up to speed on a new profession within 
          nine months, and it’s obsolete four years later. But within 
          those three productive years, you can get very wealthy.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s much more important today to be able to become an expert 
          in a brand-new field in nine to twelve months than to have 
          studied the "right" thing a long time ago. You really care about 
          having studied the foundations, so you’re not scared of any 
          book. If you go to the library and there’s a book you cannot 
          understand, you have to dig down and say, "What is the foundation 
          required for me to learn this?" <span id="foundations">_______</span>
          are super important.
